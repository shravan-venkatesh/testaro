/*
  focAll
  This test reports discrepancies between focusable and Tab-focused element counts. The test first
  counts all the visible focusable (i.e. with tabIndex 0) elements (except counting each group of
  radio buttons as only one focusable element). Then it repeatedly presses the Tab (or Option-Tab
  in webkit) key until it has reached all the elements it can and counts those elements. If the
  two counts differ, navigation can be made more difficult. The cause may be surprising changes in
  content during navigation with the Tab key, or inability to reach every focusable element (or
  widget, such as one radio button or tab in each group) merely by pressing the Tab key.
